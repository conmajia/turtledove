## Introduction

[cnblogs](https://www.cnblogs.com/) is one of China's, also the world's, largest online communities for programmers and coders. It provides every member a personal weblog to author articles and share brillant minds. However, the official themes for these blogs are extremely terrible both in appearance and coding styles. As modern programmers, we cannot withstand such *** looks.

Fortunately, these blogs support custom JavaScript and CSS, allowing us to customize our own themes.

The `turtledove` project is a single-page application (SPA) that utilizes `vue.js` with all components, templates, styles, and scripts stored in blog posts. Thus, the blog owners can modify his/her blog theme right at the site without any third-party code management.

## Features

- `vue.js`-based
- supports `vuetify`, `element-ui`, or other modern frontend frameworks
- unlimited _internal_ (stored in posts) scripts and styles
